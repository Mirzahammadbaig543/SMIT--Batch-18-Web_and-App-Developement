    <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Photography</h1>

    <p>
        Photography allows me to capture the beauty of the world around me.
        I love exploring new places and freezing special moments through my camera lens.
        Every picture tells a story, and I enjoy experimenting with light, angles, and colors.
        It's not just about taking photos â€” it's about expressing emotions and preserving memories.
        Photography helps me see the world from different perspectives and appreciate little details.

    <p class="bonus-task">
        Reading books has always been my peaceful escape.
        I get lost in stories that take me to different worlds and times.
        The words written by authors inspire creativity and imagination.
        Reading helps me relax, learn, and grow as a person every single day.
