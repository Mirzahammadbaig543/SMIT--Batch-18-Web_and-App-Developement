                    The <strong>Wurlitzer electric piano</strong> is an electro-mechanical piano, created by the Rudolph
                    Wurlitzer Company of Mississippi. The Wurlitzer company itself never called the instrument an
                    "electric piano", instead inventing the phrase "Electronic Piano" and using this as a trademark
                    throughout its production.
