    <h1>Saadat Hasan Manto's Toba Tek Singh: An Irony of Partition</h1>

    <div id="styled-div">
        <h2>The Exchange of the "Mad"</h2>
        <p>
            The story is a powerful, satirical look at the chaos following the 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan. It
            begins a few years after the event when the governments of the two nations decide that even the inmates of
            lunatic asylums must be exchanged based on their religion—Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to
            India. This ridiculous order is the starting point for Manto's critique. The asylum in Lahore becomes a
            microcosm of the political and geographical confusion gripping the entire subcontinent, where the so-called
            'sane' decision-makers create more absurdity than the 'mad' people they govern. The inmates, already
            detached from reality, struggle to comprehend the idea of a divided homeland, leading to truly bizarre
            philosophical discussions.

        The most central and heartbreaking character is **Bishan Singh**, who everyone calls Toba Tek Singh after his
        ancestral village. For fifteen years, he has been silently standing and occasionally mumbling gibberish,
        interrupted only by his persistent, confused question: "Where is Toba Tek Singh?" His inability to comprehend
        the border and his attachment to his land symbolize the deep-rooted identity crisis caused by the Partition. One
        inmate, a Muslim lawyer who now only reads the *Urdu Daily*, argues with a Sikh inmate who bathes in a fountain,
        each asserting that the asylum (and therefore, they themselves) now belong entirely to their respective new
        country. Bishan Singh's simple, desperate question cuts through all this political noise, highlighting the
        fundamental tragedy of separation from one's home and roots. This text uses a HEX code to make its significance
        stand out.

        Finally, the day of the exchange arrives. Bishan Singh's friends and family, who came to visit, have to explain
        that his home village, Toba Tek Singh, now falls just across the border in India. This news, which defines his
        'fate,' is too much for him to process. As the guards attempt to move him to the side destined for India, he
        refuses to walk, taking his final, powerful stand. He struggles violently and collapses between the two rows of
        barbed wire fencing—in the narrow strip of land designated as "no-man's-land." This paragraph, using an RGB
        value, emphasizes the raw emotion of his final moments.

        The story concludes with a devastating line: "On one side, behind the barbed wire, was India, and on the other
        side, behind the barbed wire, was Pakistan. In between, on a bit of earth that had no name, lay Toba Tek Singh."
        Manto suggests that the only person who truly understood the meaninglessness of the forced division was Bishan
        Singh himself, making him the wisest, most tragic figure in the entire saga.

        <h3>Answer of a Question in my own words in a short Paragraph</h3>
        <p>
            Color names, HEX codes, and RGB values are simply three different ways to tell a computer or browser which
            shade to display. Color names (like 'red' or 'skyblue') are the easiest, but they're very limited—you only
            get a small, standard palette. HEX codes (like #ff4500) are precise, six-digit recipes where the digits are
            grouped into pairs for Red, Green, and Blue light. This is the most common method in web design because it
            gives you access to over 16 million colors with just one short code. Finally, RGB values (like rgb(255, 99,
            71)) achieve the exact same range of colors by specifying the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue components
            using decimal numbers from 0 to 255. Essentially, HEX and RGB are interchangeable ways of mixing the three
            primary colors of light, while color names are just easy shortcuts.
