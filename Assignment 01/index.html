    <p><h2><dfn>A Thousand Splendid Suns</dfn> is a 2007 novel by Afghan-American 
    <abbr title="United States Of America"> (USA)</abbr> based author <i> Khaled Hosseini</i>, 
    following the huge success of his bestselling 2003 debut <strong>The Kite Runner.</strong></h2> <br>
    <em>Mariam,</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an illegitimate teenager from Herat,
    is forced to marry a shoemaker from <strong>Kabul</strong>
    after a family tragedy. <em>Laila,</em> born a generation later, lives a relatively privileged life,
    but her life intersects with <em>Mariam's</em> when a similar tragedy forces her to accept a marriage
    proposal from <em>Mariam's</em> husband.
    Hosseini has remarked that he regards the novel as a <q>mother-daughter story</q> in contrast to
    The Kite Runner, which he considers a <q>father-son story</q>.<sup>[1] </sup>
    It continues some of the themes used in his previous work, such as familial dynamics, 
    but instead focusing primarily on female characters and their roles in contemporary Afghan society.</p>
    <p><del>Mariam was unwanted and unloved by her father.</del>
    <ins>Mariam was an unwanted child </ins> spent her days dreaming of a life she could never have.</p>
    <p>When the rocket hit, <s>Laila had lost everything.</s> 
    <sub>But she was not completely alone in her sorrow.</sub></p><hr></blockquote>
