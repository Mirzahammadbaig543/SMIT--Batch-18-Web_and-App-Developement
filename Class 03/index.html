        Religion should not be allowed to come into Politics….Religion is merely a matter between man and God.

       <p>Quaid-e-Azam said <q>Democracy is in the blood of Musalmans who look upon complete equality of manhood, Musalmans (Muslims) believe in fraternity, equality and liberty.</q></p>
       <p>We follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad <abbr title="Peach be upon him">(P.B.U.H)</abbr> . We are members of the brotherhood of Islam in which all are equal in right, dignity and self-respect. Consequently we have a special and very deep sense of unity.</p>
